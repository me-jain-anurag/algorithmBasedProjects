# Algorithm-Based Projects

This repository includes projects I've created to solidify my knowledge of algorithms.  
Each algorithm can be modified to fit different problems, and each problem can be solved with different algorithms.  
It is this **abstract nature of algorithms** that I wish to demonstrate with this repository.

## 📂 List of Contents

### 1️⃣ Mazes  
- **Maze Generator** *(I've used iterative Depth-First Search here)*  
- **Maze Solver (DFS)** *(Both recursive and iterative)*  
- **Maze Solver (BFS)** *(Used Breadth-First Search here)*  

I'll keep including more projects as I go on.

## 🎨 Visual Renderings  

I've also tried my hand at **rendering these projects** to make them more visually appealing in my **[SFML Renderings](https://github.com/me-jain-anurag/SFML-renderings)** repository.
